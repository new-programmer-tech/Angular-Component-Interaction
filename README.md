# Angular Component Interaction
Here is a exmaple to understand how we can pass data to one component from another component.

```
> npm install -g @angular/cli    #install angular-cli. Skip if already installed
> ng new project-name            #create new project
> cd project-name                #move into our new project folder
> code .                         #open folder in VS Code
> ng serve
```

Ng serve will run a development server on http://localhost:4200 and auto refresh our browser whenever we do any update to our code inside our project folder.
